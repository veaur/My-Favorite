      Music is an amazing thing. Everyone loves some type of music. Music for me
      is one of my favourite things because is has the ability to change its
      vibe. Music can change peoples emotions and by doing so music gives people
      the ability to connect. Music has many different types such as jazz,
      hip-hop, and rock, but my top 3 favourite types of music are.

      Favourite Thing.

    <h2 id="silver">#2 Cars</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cars are cool. They help everyone move, transport goods, and some cars
      look super cool. I've grown up around cars since I was young and I've
      always liked looking at cool cars older or newer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favourite car is a
      <a

      Especially the 2021 version of the car.

      mean look how nice the car looks.

      I will forever be hooked on gaming. From the computer, console, keyboard,
      controller, everything has its roll. Gaming is fun because it feeds you
      dopamine. Dopamine is that thing that makes you feel happy.
    </p>
    <p>Some of my favourite games I've played most recently consist of</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops6">
          <b> Call of Duty Black Ops 6</b>

      All of the things I listed are truley amazing to me because of the impact
      they have on myself and others. From music to gaming i enjoy being able to
      zone out. Cars are cool because of all the parts in the car and how the
      car looks. This is why these are my favourite things.
